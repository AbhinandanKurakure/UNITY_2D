    you. You think.\r\n\r\nBit tough to hear yourself think above the thumping machinery.
    However, in front of you is the emergency exit door. It has an oversized, cast
    iron lock hanging from a bolted handle. You could try picking the lock, or maybe
    look for a way to pry it off.\r\n\r\nWhat to do?\r\n\r\n1. Pick it.\r\n2. Pry
    it."
